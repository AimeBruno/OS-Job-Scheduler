# OS-Job-Scheduler
This simple application written in javascript is designed to simulator an operatin system job scheduler.
It asks users to input the number of incoming proccesses that they wish to simulate (this must be an integer).
Users then must choose a scheduling algorithm. 
The choices of algorthims are:
* First Come First Serve (FCFS).
* Shortest Job next (SJN).
* Round Robin (RR).\
Next, users input arrival times of the processes as well as life cycle times (One for each proccess).
